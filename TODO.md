## Immediate

- alternative if there is no project photo
- Profile detail page
- Research Parse vs Express backend
- Implement backend
- save date when project completed
- don't let user submit address without completing all three parts
- move address, client etc to top so that it does not move page back to top when navigating back
- make sure all ng-shows and ng-hides are setup
- required phone input
- get rid of stupid highlight when clicked thing

## Nice to Have

- Highlight overdue dates
- Create template from project summary (used on three separate pages)
